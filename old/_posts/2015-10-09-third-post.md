Hello.

This is Michael. 

Today, I had the day off and was able to just work on whatever projects I desired - including completely redesigning my GitHub.io page. I beautified it (lots of colors!) and added much needed blog features, like a beautiful design and navigation buttons, as well as a comments feature which I'm going to keep turned off for now.

This post is going to be a fairly short one, as there's truly not much to it. This post is mainly serving as a test for future development, especially since I'm going to delete this before I upload the renewed website to GitHub. Truth be told, I seriously can't wait to have this all up and going - it's going to be fantastic. 

Lastly, I'd like to introduce a little project of mine called Iris. Iris is a highly ambitious project, and based on the way that things are going, I'm just hoping that some version of it gets done at some point, because I've essentially lost the motivation to work on it. What it aims to do, however, is interpret a code language very similar to human language which will be called (*gasp*) Iris, and then compile that with a homebuilt compiler into a simple Java executable. More info and development updates to come, but in the meantime, that's all.
